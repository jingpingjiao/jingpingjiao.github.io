Congratulations, you've found the secret habitat of Jingping, a friendly developer.

Jingping is a **Software Engineer at Google**, fixing bugs and sort.

Before that, he was an **iOS engineer at SeaGroup** in Singapore, whereby he spent most of times on [AirPay](http://www.seagroup.com/products/airpay) and [Beetalk](https://www.beetalkmobile.com/). 

While building stuff is all cool and fun, Jingping is also super passionate about **Machine Learning and Natural Language Process(NLP)**.  He encountered them during his time as an undergrad. He fell in love with them ever since. 

During his spare time, Jingping loves reading detective novels, exploring nature via hiking and playing the chromatic harmonica.

Feel free to ping him at elleryjiao on Gmail :)
