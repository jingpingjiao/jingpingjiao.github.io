> Hello world!

Congratulations, you've found the secret habitat of Jingping, a friendly developer. He is working as a mobile dev (mostly fixing bugs). 

While building stuff is all cool and fun, He is also super passionate about **Machine Learning and Natural Language Process(NLP)**.  He encountered them during his time as an undergrad. He fell in love with them ever since. 

During his spare time, Jingping loves reading detective novels, exploring nature via hiking and playing the chromatic harmonica.
